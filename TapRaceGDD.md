##Gameplay
The screen will be split into two sides, one for each player. Each player will tap on their side of the screen on their character as fast as they can to propel their character forwards. The player that reaches the goal first wins.

The goal could be the edge of the screen or a static point on a map. If the goal is the edge of the screen, the player would win be getting sufficiently ahead of their opponent. This would test stamina, as the player who wins would most likely be the one that can tap for the longest.

If the goal is a static point on the map, it is a test of who can tap most quickly during a set amount of time. 

###Items
Items are objects that can be tapped on to give the player an advantage, such as boosting, auto-tapping, or a covering the opponents side of the screen. Items will be passed by players, and if they are not fast enough they will miss the opportunity to use it.

###Levels
To add variety, there wil be different levels with different themes. An example could be a level set in space, where the characters that the players control are spaceships and the background is stars and planets. 

##States

There will be two different states - a menu state and a level state. The menu state is for information and selecting a level. The level state is where the races will be done. The level state changes depending on the level chosen.

###Menu State
The menu system will work by having "screens" that can be moved between by swiping to the left or the right. There are three unique screens, as well as a variable number of level screens.

####Title
A screen displaying the title of the game on top of a background composed of screenshots from different levels.

####Level
A screen displaying the name of a level at the top overlaid on an image of the level (or possibly an artistic rendition of the level). Tapping on a level screen will start that level.

####Statistics
This screen shows best times and which side has won the most.

####About
This screen details information about the developer as well as language used.

###Level State
Levels will start with a countdown from three on both of the screens. Once the countdown is over, the tapping will start. Levels will end when one or both of the players has reached the goal.
